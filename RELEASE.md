  Footnotes are now a **superset** of GFM Footnotes. This implies some changes

    - Footnote definitions (`[^footnote_id]`) must come at the end of your document (_GFM_)
    - Footnotes that are not referenced are not rendered anymore (_GFM_)

  Kudos to [José Valim](https://github.com/josevalim)

- [Add lookahead for fenced code blocks (#70)](https://github.com/robertdober/earmark_parser/pull/70)

    * Do lookaheads for fenced code blocks

    Prior to this commit, we were trying to parse
    all lines between fenced code blocks, which
    could be very expensive. Therefore we lookahead
    fences and convert them to text.

    * Do not scan lines in parallel anymore

    * Remove unused code blocks

    * Handle fenced blocks wrapped in tags

    * Clean up regex

    * More corner cases

    * Optimize text creation

    * Optimize length checks

    changes

## 1.4.8 2020/06/29

This marks the first release of the parser isolated from the rest of Earmark.

It is feature identical to the 1.4.7 release of Earmark.

All releases below were Earmark, all releases above are only EarmarkParser.

    Fixed some of them, alas not all

## 1.4.5 2020/06/06

This is mostly a bugfix release, as there were edge cases that resulted in
Earmark crashing, notably

  - Bare IAL
  - unquoted attributes in html tags

Also autolinks (GFM extension) delivered incorrect URLS where parenthesis were involved,
for better GFM compatibility we therefore

  - Fixed broken parenthesis links (99% of all cases)
  - introduced the same URL encoding/decoding in links and link names of autolinks as GFM does

And last but not least all numeric options in the CLI can now be written with
underlines for readability.

- [338  Deprecation warnings in mixfile removed](https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/338)

## 1.4.3 2019/11/23

- [309 fenced code allows for more than 3 backticks/tildes now](https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/309)

- [302 Earmark.version returned a charlist, now a string](https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/302)

- [298 Blockquotes nested in lists only work with an indentation of 2 spaces](https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/298)


## 1.4.2 2019/10/14

- [296 code for tasks removed from package](https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/296)
    The additional tasks are only needed for dev and have been removed from the hex package. **Finally**
- [PR#293 Nice fix for broken TOC links in README](https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/pull/293)
  Kudos to Ray Gesualdo [raygesualdo](https://github.com/raygesualdo)
- [291 Transformer whitespace inside / around &lt;code> &lt;pre> tags](https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/291)
    The spurious whitespace has been removed
- [289 HTML Problem](https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/289)
    The AST parser can now correctly distinguish between _generated_ AST (from md) and _parsed_ AST (from HTML)
- [288 Metadata allowed to be added to the AST](https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/288)
    The default HTML Transformer ignores metadata in the form of a map with the exception of `%{meta: ...}`

## 1.4.1 2019/09/24

- [282 Always create a `<tbody>` in tables](https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/282)
    Although strictly speaking a `<tbody>` is only needed when there is a `<thead>`, semantic
    HTML suggests the presence of `<tbody>` anyway.

- [281 Urls in links were URL endoded, that is actually a bug ](https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/281)
    It is the markdown author's responsibility to url encode her urls, if she does so correctly
    we double encoded the url before this fix.

- [279 Languages in code blocks were limited to alphanum names, thus excluding, e.g. C# ](https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/279)

- [278 Implementing better GFM Table support ](https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/278)
  Because of compatility issues we use a new option `gfm_tables` defaulting to `false` for this.
  Using this option `Earmark` will implement its own table extension **+** GFM tables at the same
  time.

- [277 Expose an AST to HTML Transformer](https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/277)
  While it should be faster to call `to_ast|>transform` it cannot be used instead of `as_html` yet
  as the API is not yet stable and some subtle differences in the output need to be addressed.


## 1.4.0 2019/09/05

- [145 Expose AST for output manipulation]( https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/145)

- [238 Pure Links are default now]( https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/238)

- [256 Align needed Elixir Version with ex_doc (>= 1.7)]( https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/256)

- [265 Make deprecated `Earmark.parse/2` private]( https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/265)


## 1.3.6 2019/08/30

Hopefully the last patch release of 1.3 before the structural changes of 1.4.

-  [#270]( https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/270)
      Error messages during parsing of table cells were duplicated in a number, exponential to the number of table cells.

-  [#268]( https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/268)
      Deprecation warnings concerning pure links showed fixed link to https://github.com/pragdave/earmark, at least a reasonable choice ;),
      instead of the text of the link.

-  [#266]( https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/266)
    According to HTML5 Style Guide better XHTML compatibility by closing void tags e.g. `<hr>` --&gt; `<hr />`


## 1.3.5 2019/08/01

-  [#264]( https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/264)
      Expose `Earmark.parse/2` but deprecate it.

-  [#262]( https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/262)
    Remove non XHTML tags <colgroup> and <col>


-  [#236]( https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/236)
      Deprecation of plugins.

-  [#257]( https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/257)
      Deprecation of `sanitize` option.

## 1.3.4 2019/07/29


- [#254 pure links inside links](https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/254)

## 1.3.3 2019/07/23

### Bugs
- [#240 code blocks in lists](https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/240)
    Bad reindentation inside list items led to code blocks not being verabtim =&rt; Badly formatted hexdoc for Earmark

- [#243 errors in unicode link names](https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/243)
    Regexpression was not UTF, thus some links were not correctly parsed
    Fixed in PR [244](https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/pull/244)
    Thank you [Stéphane ROBINO](https://github.com/StephaneRob)

### Features

- [#158 some pure links implemented](https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/issues/158)
    This GFM like behavior is more and more expected, I will issue a PR for `ex_doc` on this as discussed with
    [José Valim](https://github.com/josevalim)
    Deprecation Warnings are issued by default, but will be suppressed for `ex_doc` in said PR.

-  Minor improvements on documentation
    In PR [235](https://github.com/pragdave/earmark/pull/235)
    Thank you - [Jason Axelson](https://github.com/axelson)

## 0.1.19 2015/10/27

* Fix | in implicit lists, and restructur the parse a little.
  Many thanks to Robert Dober

## 0.1.17 2015/05/18

* Add strikethrough support to the HTML renderer. Thanks to
  Michael Schaefermeyer (mschae)


## 0.1.16 2015/05/08

* Another fix from José, this time for & in code blocks.


## 0.1.15 2015/03/25

* Allow numbered lists to start anywhere in the first four columns.
  (This was previously allowed for unnumbered lists). Fixes #13.


## 0.1.14 2015/03/25

* Fixed a problem where a malformed text heading caused a crash.
  We now report what appears to be malformed Markdown and
  continue, processing the line as text. Fixes #17.


## 0.1.13 2015/01/31

* José fixed a bug in Regex that revealed a problem with some
  Earmark replacement strings. As he's a true gentleman, he then
  fixed Earmark.


## 0.1.11 2014/08/18

* Matthew Lyon contributed footnote support.

      the answer is clearly 42.[^fn-why] In this case
      we need to…

      [^fn-why]: 42 is the only two digit number with
                 the digits 4 and 2 that starts with a 4.

  For now, consider it experimental. For that reason, you have
  to enable it by passing the `footnotes: true` option.


## 0.1.10 2014/08/13

* The spec is ambiguous when it comes to setext headings. I assumed
  that they needed a blank line after them, but common practice says
  no. Changed the parser to treat them as headings if there's no
  blank.


## 0.1.9 2014/08/05

* Bug fix—extra blank lines could be appended to code blocks.
* Tidied up code block HTML


## 0.1.7 2014/07/26

* Block rendering is now performed in parallel


## 0.1.6 07/25/14

* Added support for Kramdown-style attribute annotators for all block
  elements, so you can write

        # Warning
        {: .red}

        Do not turn off the engine
        if you are at altitude.
        {: .boxed #warning spellcheck="true"}

  and generate

        <h1 class="red">Warning</h1>
        <p spellcheck="true" id="warning" class="boxed">Do not turn
        off the engine if you are at altitude.</p>


## 0.1.5 07/20/14

* Merged two performance improvements from José Valim
* Support escaping of pipes in tables, so

        a  |  b
        c  |  d \| e

  has two columns, not three.


## 0.1.4 07/14/14

* Allow list bullets to be indented, and deal with potential subsequent
  additional indentation of the body of an item.


## 0.1.3 07/14/14

* Added tasks to the Hex file list


## 0.1.2 07/14/14

* Add support for GFM tables
